# Scroll Scrub Video Component

A web component which displays videos which scrub as you scroll the page. 

[Demo here](https://chrishow.github.io/scroll-scrub-video-component/demo.html)

## :rocket: Development scripts

```npm install```

Installs node dependencies.

```npm run build```

Builds the component.

```npm run build:watch```

Used to automatically rebuild the component as soon as any changes are made to the code.

```npm run serve```

Serves the component locally (from _index.html_).


## :construction_worker: Other commands

```npm run build:bundle```

Bundles the component into a single file (to _dist/scroll-scrub-video-component.bundle.js_). This is great for serving the component via a CDN, such as [UPKG](https://unpkg.com/) ([example](https://codesandbox.io/s/scroll-scrub-video-cdn-3ouokv?file=/index.html)).

```npm run analyze```

Builds a [custom elements manifest](https://github.com/webcomponents/custom-elements-manifest) (_custom-elements.json_) which can be used by assistive tools to benefit the custom element development experience.
